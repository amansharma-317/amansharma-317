- 👋 Hi, I’m @amansharma-317
- 👀 I’m interested in how different technologies work and getting to know other developers from various fields, not necessarily computer science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning flutter, a UI-Toolkit for cross-platform development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on freelance projects in application development, and also building new solutions for existing problems.
- 📫you can reach me through instagram (@amansharma.317) or mail.
